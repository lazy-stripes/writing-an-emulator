# Writing an emulator: example code

This repository contains example programs that are part of a series of blog articles about writing a Game Boy emulator.

The articles can be found here: https://blog.tigris.fr/category/emulator/

These programs are *very* heavily commented and should run on their own as long as there is a `dmg-rom.bin` file in the same folder. I hope they can prove useful, or even mildly informative.
